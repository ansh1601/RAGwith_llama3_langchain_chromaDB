# 🚀 RAG Implementation with Llama 3, LangChain, and ChromaDB  

## 📌 Overview  
This project leverages **Llama 3**, **LangChain**, and **ChromaDB** to implement a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system**. The system allows users to query documents, even when the specific information was not part of the original training data of the **Large Language Model (LLM)**.  

RAG works by first retrieving relevant documents from a **vector database**, where indexed data is stored in high-dimensional representations. The retrieved context is then used to enhance the LLM’s responses, making them more informed and accurate.

## 🛠️ Key Components  

- **Llama 3** – A powerful open-source LLM developed by **Meta**  
- **LangChain** – A framework for seamless LLM-based application development  
- **ChromaDB** – A high-performance **vector database** for efficient document retrieval  
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** – A technique that enhances LLM responses by integrating external knowledge sources
